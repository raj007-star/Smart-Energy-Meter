## Overview

The Smart Energy Meter System is an IoT-based project designed to monitor and manage energy consumption efficiently. This project combines hardware components like NodeMCU, ACS712 current sensor, and Arduino Uno with software solutions like Adafruit IO and Zapier to provide real-time energy usage data and control capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Energy Monitoring:** Continuously measures and reports energy consumption data.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Allows users to monitor energy usage remotely through Adafruit IO.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends notifications and alerts via Zapier based on predefined thresholds.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Provides insights to optimize energy consumption patterns.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for both monitoring and controlling energy usage.

## Hardware Components

- NodeMCU 8266: The IoT development platform used for data collection and communication.
- ACS712 Current Sensor: Measures current flow to calculate energy consumption.
- Arduino Uno: Controls and processes sensor data.
- Wires: Connect components and sensors.

## Software Components

- Arduino IDE: Used to program the Arduino Uno.
- Adafruit IO: An IoT platform for real-time data visualization and management.
- Zapier: Automates alerts and notifications.
- Additional libraries for sensor interfacing.

## Installation
